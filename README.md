# Anomaly-Detection-in-Milling-Operation-using-Variational-Autoencoders
 Developed VAE to perform anomaly detection task on UC Berkeley milling dataset. Performed exploratory data  analysis on the UC Berkeley milling dataset, followed by building and training variational autoencoder to perform  the task of anomaly detection by classifying toolwear into Healthy, Degraded and Failed.
